// This file was intentionally left blank or removed in the previous step
// as Firebase auth was removed.
// A new Supabase auth context/hook is created at src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx
// This placeholder can be deleted if no longer referenced, or kept if other
// non-auth hooks might be added here later. For now, it's empty to avoid
// conflicts with the new AuthContext.tsx.
